# Car_Sales_Statistics
The Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the car sales dataset provided several insightful observations regarding the data distribution, central tendencies, and variability across different features.

Key Insights

Price Distribution: Car prices show significant variability with some extreme outliers.

Brand Popularity: Certain brands are more prevalent in the dataset, which may indicate market trends or the focus of the dataset.

Body Type Distribution: The majority of the cars fall into a few common body types.

Mileage Distribution: Most cars have relatively low mileage, with a few high-mileage outliers.

Statistical Measures: Variance and standard deviation provide insights into the spread and dispersion of the numerical features, while skewness analysis helps understand the data symmetry.

Recommendations
Based on the EDA, further steps could include:

Outlier Treatment: Addressing the outliers identified to improve model performance in machine learning tasks.

Feature Engineering: Creating new features or transforming existing ones based on insights from the data analysis.

Deeper Analysis: Conducting more domain-specific analysis or hypothesis testing based on the initial findings.

This analysis provides a solid foundation for more advanced data modeling and machine learning applications. By sharing this notebook on GitHub, others can replicate, review, and build upon this work, fostering collaboration and furthering insights into the car sales dataset.
