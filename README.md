# Car_Sales_Statistics
The Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the car sales dataset provided several insightful observations regarding the data distribution, central tendencies, and variability across different features.
Below is a summary of the findings:

Data Cleaning:

Missing and duplicate values were identified and removed, ensuring the integrity and quality of the dataset.
Data Distribution:

Price: The box plot and histogram revealed the distribution and presence of outliers in the car prices.
Mileage: Similarly, the distribution of mileage was analyzed, highlighting the range and common values.
Brand Analysis:

The dataset includes a variety of car brands, with their counts visualized through a bar plot. The brand distribution indicated the prevalence of certain brands over others.
Body Type Analysis:

The percentage distribution of different car body types was calculated and visualized using a pie chart, providing insights into the common car body types in the dataset.
Statistical Analysis:

Variance and standard deviation were computed for numerical columns, providing a measure of dispersion and spread of the data.
The Interquartile Range (IQR) method was used to identify outliers in the numerical columns.
Skewness:

The skewness of numerical columns was calculated to understand the symmetry of data distribution. The results indicated whether the data is symmetrical, left-skewed, or right-skewed.
Visualizations:

Histograms for all numerical columns were plotted, allowing for a comprehensive view of the data distribution and frequency of values.

Key Insights

Price Distribution: Car prices show significant variability with some extreme outliers.

Brand Popularity: Certain brands are more prevalent in the dataset, which may indicate market trends or the focus of the dataset.

Body Type Distribution: The majority of the cars fall into a few common body types.

Mileage Distribution: Most cars have relatively low mileage, with a few high-mileage outliers.

Statistical Measures: Variance and standard deviation provide insights into the spread and dispersion of the numerical features, while skewness analysis helps understand the data symmetry.

Recommendations
Based on the EDA, further steps could include:

Outlier Treatment: Addressing the outliers identified to improve model performance in machine learning tasks.

Feature Engineering: Creating new features or transforming existing ones based on insights from the data analysis.

Deeper Analysis: Conducting more domain-specific analysis or hypothesis testing based on the initial findings.

This analysis provides a solid foundation for more advanced data modeling and machine learning applications. By sharing this notebook on GitHub, others can replicate, review, and build upon this work, fostering collaboration and furthering insights into the car sales dataset.
